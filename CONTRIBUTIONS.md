# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in this project! We appreciate that you've taken the time to explore the codebase.

## Important Notice

**This repository is not accepting pull requests or direct contributions.**

### Why?

This codebase serves as the **live production frontend** for a commercial service. Any changes directly impact:
- Paying customers
- Service uptime and reliability
- Business operations
- Revenue generation

Accepting external contributions would introduce:
- Deployment risks to production environment
- Code review overhead that diverts from service maintenance
- Potential breaking changes affecting active users
- Support burden for contributed features

## How You Can Still Benefit

While we're not accepting PRs, this repository is open source specifically so you can:

### ✅ **Study the Implementation**
- Review the anti-abuse mechanisms
- Understand the VPN detection patterns
- Learn from the webhook integration approach
- Examine the state management patterns

### ✅ **Fork and Adapt**
- Create your own version for different use cases
- Modify for your specific workflow monetization needs
- Build upon the patterns demonstrated here
- Use as a starting point for your own service

### ✅ **Share Feedback**
- Open GitHub Issues for **bug reports** (production issues only)
- Open GitHub Issues for **security vulnerabilities** (we take these seriously)
- Discuss implementation approaches in Issues (we'll engage when possible)
- Share your own implementations inspired by this code

## What About Bug Fixes?

If you find a bug:
1. **Open an Issue** with detailed reproduction steps
2. We'll evaluate and fix it if it affects production
3. We'll credit you in the CHANGELOG for the report
4. We'll implement the fix internally (not via PR)

## What About Feature Suggestions?

We appreciate suggestions, but:
- Features are prioritized based on business needs
- Service roadmap is driven by paying customers
- Open source users benefit from updates, but don't drive development
- Suggestions via Issues are welcome, implementation is not guaranteed

## What About Security Issues?

**Do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead:
1. Join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/AEJvSEWcZk)
2. Raise a private ticket in the support channel
3. We'll respond within 48 hours
4. Responsible disclosure is appreciated

## Can I Use This Code?

**Yes!** That's the point.

- Frontend code is MIT licensed (see LICENSE)
- Fork, modify, and use for your own projects
- No attribution required (but appreciated)
- Backend workflows are proprietary (not included in this repo)
- You're responsible for your own implementation
